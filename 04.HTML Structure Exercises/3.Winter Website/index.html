                    <h1>The Winter is Switzerland</h1>
                    <p>Winter is a fantastic time to be in Switzerland. Whereas some countries curl up and hibernate in
                        colder months, Switzerland blooms into a winter paradise, so it’s no surprise that there are a
                        ton of amazing things to do during this time. From any snowsport you care to name to first-rate
                        Christmas shopping to peaceful Alpine hikes to charming, snow-covered villages to explore – you
                        won’t be bored in winter. And as a bonus, Switzerland’s already-stunning scenery looks even more
                        impressive throughout the season.
